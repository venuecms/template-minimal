# VenueCMS template-minimal

This is a starter template for [Venue CMS](https://venuecms.com).

It is built with Next.js and uses the [Venue SDK](https://venue.gitbook.io/docs/sdk) to connect to your VenueCMS instance.
This is one of the templates we use for rendering sites when users choose to host via Venue but can also be used as a template for building your own site using the SDK.

It is currently not ready for production but will be soon as we work through the rest of the details. Lookout for the announcement and 1.0 release.

## Getting Started

First, install your dependencies:

```
pnpm install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
